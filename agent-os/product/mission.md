# Product Mission

## Problem

Filmmakers and storytellers creating virtual productions with Unreal Engine lack a unified system to organize complex world details. Information gets scattered across documents, inconsistencies creep in, and there's a gap between creative worldbuilding and production-ready specifications.

## Target Users

Solo creators and small teams working on short films, indie features, and narrative projects using virtual production pipelines.

## Solution

Vixio Worldbuilder provides:

- **Unified World Bible** — 9 structured element categories (Characters, Locations, Organizations, Events, Items, Rules, Stories, Scenes, Shots)
- **AI World Chat** — Query world data, check consistency, get story suggestions
- **Rule Enforcement** — Define world rules and catch contradictions automatically
- **Production Pipeline** — Export specs ready for MetaHuman, environments, storyboards
