## Problem (Research-Validated)

### The Core Pain: Creator's Fatigue

> "It's very tiring to come up with a logical world while still letting creativity flow."

Creators can't be **creative** and **logically consistent** at the same time. Trying to do both causes burnout:

| Creative Mode | Logical Mode |
|---------------|--------------|
| "What if..." | "But that contradicts..." |
| Flow state | Checking consistency |
| Generative | Evaluative |
| Fun | Exhausting |

Existing tools make this worse by forcing structure upfront.

### Specific Problems

1. **Tool fragmentation** - Story ideas in Google Docs, worldbuilding in World Anvil, scripts in Final Draft, production in StudioBinder. Data re-entered multiple times.

2. **Manual data entry** - Most tools require filling out forms. Creators with existing content (messy notes, world bibles) don't want to re-type everything.

3. **Structure pressure** - World Anvil and Campfire push "hard worldbuilding" (forms, relationships, tracking). This blocks creative flow for many users.

4. **Gap between idea and production** - Worldbuilding tools stop at prose. Production tools start after the script is done. Nothing bridges the gap.

5. **Price barriers** - StudioBinder ($42-99+/month) prices out small teams and solo creators.

## Core Insight

> **Assets are not attachments. Assets are the organizing metaphor.**

Creators think in terms of characters, locations, props—visual assets. But existing tools organize around text (wikis) or scripts (production tools). Vixio organizes around **visual assets**.

## Target Users

### Primary: Film & Video Productions

The core paying market. Users with real budgets and deadlines.

| Segment | Description | Willingness to Pay |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Independent filmmakers | Short films, features, documentaries | $15-35/month |
| Web series creators | YouTube, streaming platforms | $15-35/month |
| Screenwriters | Developing scripts for production | $15/month |
| Small production companies | 1-10 person teams | $35-79/month |

These users are priced out of StudioBinder but need more than spreadsheets.

### Secondary: Writers & Worldbuilders

Shared pain points, more price-sensitive. Served via free/cheap tiers.

| Segment | Description | Willingness to Pay |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Novelists | Series writers managing continuity | $0-15/month |
| TTRPG creators | Dungeon masters, campaign managers | $0-12/month |
| Worldbuilders | Fantasy/sci-fi universe creators | $0-12/month |
| Game narrative designers | Story development for games | $12-25/month |

These users often use World Anvil/Campfire and complain about complexity and structure pressure.

### Future: Animation Industry (APAC)

Attractive long-term vertical with high barriers. Requires regional infrastructure.

- Anime/donghua studios (Japan, China, Korea)
- Data residency and IP governance requirements
- Enterprise sales cycles

Architecture should remain flexible for future expansion.

## Philosophy

See [product-philosophy.md](./product-philosophy.md) for details.

**Key principles:**

1. **AI handles consistency, you stay creative** - The tool manages the "logical mode" burden so creators can stay in "creative mode"

2. **Import-first** - Paste your messy docs, AI figures it out. No forms required.

3. **Visual assets as the organizing unit** - Think in characters and places, not wiki pages

4. **Soft worldbuilding by default** - Structure is optional, creativity is primary

5. **Professional quality, accessible pricing** - No per-seat fees, no feature gatekeeping

6. **Production-ready output** - Not just prose—scripts, shot lists, production briefs

## Solution

Vixio is a **creative development and pre-production platform** that:

1. **Imports your mess** - Paste Google Docs, notes, existing world bibles. AI extracts characters, locations, relationships.

2. **Organizes around assets** - Characters, locations, props are the core units. Everything else flows from them.

3. **Handles consistency for you** - AI tracks what you've established. Flags contradictions on demand, not intrusively.

4. **Stays out of your way** - "Just Chat" mode for exploration. Structure when YOU want it.

5. **Exports to production** - Scripts (PDF, Fountain, FDX), shot lists, character briefs, schedule CSVs.

## Core Value Propositions

| For | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Filmmakers priced out of StudioBinder** | Professional pre-production at accessible pricing |
| **Creators with existing content** | Import and immediately work—no re-typing |
| **Those experiencing creator's fatigue** | AI handles consistency so you can stay creative |
| **Visual thinkers** | Assets-first organization, node-based visualization |
| **Soft worldbuilders** | Creative companion that doesn't enforce structure |
| **Small teams** | Collaboration without per-seat fees |

## What We're NOT

- Not a World Anvil clone (text-first, BB codes, feature bloat)
- Not a database you populate manually (import-first, AI-assisted)
- Not StudioBinder (no enterprise pricing, no per-seat fees)
- Not trying to do everything (focused on idea → pre-production pipeline)
- Not AI-generates-your-content (AI organizes and tracks, you create)

## Competitive Positioning

> "Professional pre-production tools. Accessible to all."

| vs World Anvil/Campfire | vs StudioBinder |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Import-first, not forms-first | Affordable, not enterprise-priced |
| Soft worldbuilding default | No per-seat fees |
| Production export, not just prose | Creative development included |
| AI handles consistency | Idea → script → production pipeline |

## Success Metrics

1. **Primary:** Users successfully go from messy ideas to production-ready docs
2. **Validation:** Paying customers in the $15-35/month range
3. **Retention:** Users prefer Vixio over their previous tool stack
4. **Growth:** Word-of-mouth in indie film communities
