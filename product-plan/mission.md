# Product Mission

## Problem

- World details scattered across documents, notes, and tools
- Existing tools are **text-first** when creators think in **visual assets**
- Manual data entry is tedious for storytellers with existing world bibles
- Learning curves are steep (BB codes, complex UIs)
- Gap between worldbuilding and production output
- No tool bridges worldbuilding to animation pre-production

## Core Insight

> **Assets are not attachments. Assets are the organizing metaphor.**

Creators think in terms of characters, locations, props - visual assets. But existing tools organize around text (wikis) or scripts (production tools). Vixio organizes around **visual assets**.

## Target Users

### Primary: Storytellers with existing content
- Writers with world bibles/documents
- Novelists managing series continuity
- Solo creators developing original IPs

### Secondary: Production professionals
- Filmmakers needing story bibles
- Screenwriters tracking character arcs
- Virtual production teams (UE, etc.)

### Tertiary: Animation industry
- Anime/donghua studios
- Animation pre-production teams
- Storyboard artists
- APAC market focus

## Philosophy

See [product-philosophy.md](./product-philosophy.md) for details.

**Key principles:**
- Visual assets are the organizing unit
- AI serves the creator, not the other way around
- Soft worldbuilding by default, hard mode optional
- Import and go - minimal friction
- Private by default
- Data ownership matters

## Solution

Vixio Worldbuilder is a **visual asset-driven creative platform** that:

1. **Organizes around assets** - Characters, locations, props are the core units, not wiki pages or scripts

2. **Understands your world** - Import existing documents, AI comprehends context

3. **Assists, doesn't enforce** - Chat about your world, get suggestions, find inconsistencies when YOU want

4. **Visualizes relationships** - Node-based diagrams showing asset connections and timeline

5. **Exports to production** - Generate screenplays, shot lists, storyboards, production briefs directly from assets

6. **Generates storyboards** - AI creates visual frames from your scenes (key differentiator)

## Core Value Propositions

| For | Value |

## What We're NOT

- Not a World Anvil clone (text-first, BB codes, feature bloat)
- Not a database you populate manually
- Not public by default
- Not subscription-hostage (ownership-first model)
- Not trying to do everything (focused core, expand later)

## Success Metrics

1. **For yourself:** Effectively organize and develop your own IPs
2. **For validation:** Others find it useful for their creative work
3. **For business:** Sustainable model that respects creators
