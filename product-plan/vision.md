# Vixio Creatives Vision

## The Company

**Vixio Creatives Ltd** (Hong Kong) is a creative production company with three interconnected focus areas.

## Core Positioning

**Visual Asset-Driven Creative Platform**

> Assets are not attachments. Assets are the organizing metaphor.

Unlike text-first worldbuilding tools or script-first production tools, Vixio treats visual assets as the primary organizational unit - connecting characters, locations, and props from initial concept through to production.

## Three Pillars

```

### 1. Original IPs (Primary Focus)

Your own stories and worlds. The core creative output.

- Developed using Worldbuilder (dogfooding)
- Eventually can become productions
- Builds creative credibility

### 2. Vixio Worldbuilder (Parallel Development)

Visual asset-driven creative platform.

- **Internal first** - Build for your own use
- **Simple SaaS later** - Extract core value to validate market
- Differentiated by visual asset-driven approach + AI-native design

### 3. Cinematics/Virtual Production Service (Opportunistic)

Production services when opportunities arise.

- **Tool-agnostic** - Use whatever fits (UE, Blender, etc.)
- Asset governance included
- Have 3D artist contact for execution
- Generates cash to fund primary work

## Priority Order

```
PRIMARY (active focus)
├── Your Stories/IPs
└── Worldbuilder (built with Cursor as you go)
        │
        │ Develops simultaneously
        ▼
BACKGROUND (opportunistic)
└── Cinematics Service
    └── Take projects when they come
    └── Funds the primary work
```

## Target Markets

### Primary Markets
- **Storytellers** with existing world content
- **Solo creators** developing original IPs
- **Screenwriters** and novelists

### Secondary Markets
- **Live-action filmmakers** needing story bibles and production docs
- **Virtual production teams** (Unreal Engine, etc.)

### Emerging Markets
- **APAC Animation** (China, Japan, Korea)
- **Anime/Donghua studios** needing pre-production tools
- See [markets/apac-regional.md](./markets/apac-regional.md)

## Regional Product Strategy (Future)

APAC markets require **separate regional versions** with:
- **Dedicated data centers** per region (IP asset governance)
- **Local compliance** (China PIPL, Japan APPI, Korea PIPA)
- **Cultural adaptation** (not just translation)
- **Local integrations** (WeChat, LINE, KakaoTalk)

| Version | Market | Data Residency |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Vixio (Global) | International | US/EU |
| Vixio CN | China | China |
| Vixio JP | Japan | Japan |
| Vixio KR | Korea | Korea |

This addresses a critical concern for animation studios: **where their IP assets are stored**.

## Strategic Goals

| Goal | Path |
|------|------|
| Create original content | Develop IPs using Worldbuilder |
| Build production studio capability | Cinematics service, grow team over time |
| B2B relationships with IP holders | Through services AND own IP success |
| Serve animation industry | APAC market with visual asset-driven approach |

## Key Differentiator

**Visual Asset-Driven** approach solves gaps across all markets:

| Market | The Gap | Visual Asset-Driven Solution |
|--------|---------|------------------------------|
| Worldbuilding | Text can't become visual | Assets ARE visual, text describes them |
| Live-Action | Worldbuilding disconnected from production | Assets generate production docs directly |
| Animation | Static designs can't become reusable assets | Assets ARE the reusable elements |
| All Markets | Information scattered across tools | Assets are the single source of truth |

## Common Principle

The three pillars share a common principle: **Visual assets as the organizing unit for creative work.**

- Worldbuilder = Visual assets drive world organization
- Asset Governance (for clients) = Visual assets drive production organization
- Your IPs = Visual assets drive your creative development
