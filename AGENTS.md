## Mandatory Rules

1. **95% Confidence Rule**: Do NOT make changes until you have 95% confidence you understand what to build. Ask clarifying questions until you reach that confidence. This applies to ALL work - features, bugfixes, refactors, documentation.

2. **Always Recommend with Reasoning**: When presenting options, ALWAYS include your recommendation and explain WHY. Don't just list options neutrally - lead with your recommendation and reasoning, then present alternatives.

3. **Brainstorm Before Build**: Use the `brainstorming` skill before any creative work. Never skip this step.

4. **Verify Before Claiming Done**: Use the `verification-before-completion` skill before claiming any work is complete.

5. **Update Docs After Actions**: After completing any task, update relevant documentation:
   - Update `docs/current-sprint.md` with progress
   - Update roadmap if scope changes
   - Update implementation plan if approach changes
   - Never leave documentation stale

## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->
<usage>
When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

How to use skills:
- Invoke: `npx openskills read <skill-name>` (run in your shell)
  - For multiple: `npx openskills read skill-one,skill-two`
- The skill content will load with detailed instructions on how to complete the task
- Base directory provided in output for resolving bundled resources (references/, scripts/, assets/)

Usage notes:
- Only use skills listed in <available_skills> below
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded in your context
- Each skill invocation is stateless
</usage>
