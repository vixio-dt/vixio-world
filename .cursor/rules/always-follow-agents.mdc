# Always Follow AGENTS.md

Read and follow `AGENTS.md` at the repository root for all development work.

## Key Requirements

1. **95% Confidence** - Ask clarifying questions before making changes
2. **Recommend with Reasoning** - Always explain WHY when presenting options
3. **Brainstorm Before Build** - Use `/brainstorm` before creative work
4. **Verify Before Done** - Use `/verify` before claiming completion
5. **Update Docs** - Keep `docs/current-sprint.md` current
6. **MCP-First** - Consult MCP specialists before implementing (see `mcp-first.mdc`)

## Pre-Action Checklist

**Before ANY implementation work**, run the checklist in `pre-action-checklist.mdc`:
- 95% confidence check
- Brainstorm if creative work
- MCP consultation if external data/APIs
- Plan exists for complex work
- Matching skill identified

## Key Commands

| Command | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `/continue` | **Run checklist and proceed** - Use instead of "continue" |
| `/brainstorm` | Design session before building |
| `/verify` | Pre-completion verification |

See AGENTS.md for full command list.
