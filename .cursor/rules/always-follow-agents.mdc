# Always Follow AGENTS.md

This project uses AGENTS.md as the source of truth for AI agent behavior.

## Required Actions

1. **Read AGENTS.md first** - Before any work, ensure you understand the project rules in AGENTS.md at the repository root.

2. **95% Confidence Rule** - Do NOT make changes until you have 95% confidence you understand what to build. Ask clarifying questions until you reach that confidence.

3. **Use Available Skills** - Check if any skills listed in AGENTS.md apply to your task. Invoke them before proceeding:
   - `brainstorming` - Before any creative work (features, components, modifications)
   - `writing-plans` - Before multi-step tasks
   - `verification-before-completion` - Before claiming work is done
   - `systematic-debugging` - Before proposing fixes for bugs

4. **Recommend with Reasoning** - When presenting options, always include your recommendation and explain WHY.

5. **Update Documentation** - After completing tasks, update relevant docs (current-sprint.md, roadmap, plans).

## Prohibited Actions

- Making changes without 95% confidence in requirements
- Skipping brainstorming for creative work
- Claiming completion without verification
- Leaving documentation stale after changes
