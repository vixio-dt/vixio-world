2. **Recommend with Reasoning** - Always explain WHY when presenting options
3. **Brainstorm Before Build** - Use `/brainstorm` before creative work

5. **Update Docs** - Keep `docs/current-sprint.md` current

## Available Commands

Three subagents available for parallel execution:
- `implementer` - Execute tasks

- `code-reviewer` - Review code quality
